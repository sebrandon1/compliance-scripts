## About Remediation Groupings

Remediation groupings consolidate individual compliance check failures into logical groups that can be addressed together. Each group typically results in a single MachineConfig or CRD that remediates multiple related checks.

**Grouping Categories:**
- **SSHD Hardening** - SSH daemon security settings
- **Kernel Sysctl** - Kernel security parameters
- **Audit Rules** - System auditing configuration
- **Crypto Policy** - Cryptographic standards
- **API Server** - OpenShift API server settings
- **PAM Configuration** - Pluggable Authentication Modules

**Status Legend:**
- 🔵 **In Progress** - Active PR open for remediation
- 🟡 **Pending** - Not yet started
- ⚪ **On Hold** - Paused (e.g., focusing on higher severity first)
- 🟢 **Complete** - Merged and verified
